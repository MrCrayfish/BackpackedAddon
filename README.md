# Backpacked Addon Example
This repository has been set up to show how to create an addon for Backpacked. You can use this mod as a starting template to create your addon. You will find a Blockbench project (`backpack_template.bbmodel`) that you can use to create new models. It is important that you do not change the structure of the Blockbench project, do not move/rename `backpack`, `bag`, and `strap` or your model will not work correct once you add it in. The model should be exported as a Java Entity. I've added some comments to the code to help understand what you need to do. 

You are free to use the code and assets in this repository however you like!

Make sure `Render Sides` in blockbench is set to show both sides. Auto should be doing this but didn't in my quick test.
